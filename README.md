# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By training models on meteorological data, we aim to forecast rainfall more accurately, which can help in disaster prevention, agricultural planning, and climate monitoring.
